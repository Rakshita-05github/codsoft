                In addition to selling your product or service, you need to build up your brand and get a following of people who are interested in what your business offers.

Doing so allows employers to manage labor costs and increase productivity.</p></li>

        <h2><U>ABOUT US</U></h2>
        <p>
            Business is the practice of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit."

Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.The taxation system for businesses is different from that of the corporates. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
